### Context
The website is designed for an established, yet fictional, tattoo parlour in Calgary. The site is a first draft of a responsive one page website. The tattoo parlour's main goal is to attract new customers and provide them with contact information.

The webpage would include a call to action, about information, contact information, individual artist cards, and a gallery of the current/best tattoo-art. A log-in and sign-up would be added later on to further increase the websites capabilities.
### Future updates, fixes, and modifications
* Add a social links bar
* ~~Add artist cards using flexbox~~
* Add Gallery using grid
* ~~Add a script to animate hamburger menu~~
* Add login/sign-up
